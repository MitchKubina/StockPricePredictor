Stock Price Predicting using sklearn's machine learning algorithms

This repository is a culmination of my process to create a simple stock price predictor program using Sklearn's machine learning algorithms

After doing cleaning, modifying, and training the data, I was able to achieve a precision score of ~.57 for correctly predicting when a stock was to go up.
